  background is required - everything should be understandable with a bit of
  effort on the part of the reader.

# Course outline

Part 1: What are SNARKs?

1. Argument of Knowledge
2. zkSNARKs in Action

Part 2: Math (to get to PLONK)

1. Fundamental Objects: Modular Arithmetic, Groups, and Fields
2. Schwartz-Zippel Lemma and Polynomials
3. Elliptic Curves and the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLOG)
4. Polynomial Commitment Schemes (PCS)

Part 3: Proof Systems

1. PLONK
2. Comparing Proof Systems&#x20;



Part 1 of this course take you from:

```
no mathematical background ===> high-level understanding of SNARKs
```

By the end of Part 1 you should have some intuition for what is and isn't possible with SNARK technology.



Part 2 of this course take you from:

```
high-level understanding of SNARKs ===> functional understanding of SNARKs
```

Part 2 will delve into the mathematics and applied aspects of SNARKs. After Part 2, you should be able to understand how and why SNARKs are able to verify computations.&#x20;



Part 3 of this course take you from:

```markup
functional understanding of SNARKs ===> ability to meaningfully engage with SNARKS
```

By the end of Part 3, you should have enough understanding about this technology to engage in high level, meaningful conversations about it. And hopefully know enough to start building. \
