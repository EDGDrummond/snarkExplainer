# Mathematical guarantees&#x20;
---
description: 'Core concept: zkSNARKs give probabilistic claims'
---

# Verifiable computation
---
description: >-
  Core concept: zkSNARKs are a type of VC, and that is a simpler way to think
  about them conceptually
---

# Computer Circuits
---
description: 'Core concept: circuits are constraints that a set of values must satisfy'
---

# ZK-Circuits
---
description: >-
  Core concept: zkSNARKs are claims that a prover knows a valid witness to some
  set of constraints

zkSNARKs in Action

# 2. zkSNARKs in Action
---
description: >-
  Core concept: How do we create useful circuits, or how do we turn things we
  care about into useful circuits?
---


# Idealized Circuits
---
description: >-
  Core concept: idealized circuits represent the core idea of what a computation
  should do without any detail
---


# Useful circuits
---
description: >-
  Core concept: zk-proofs have value based on what real-world computation it
  claims to have done
---

# Polynomials
---
description: 'Core concept: zkSNARKs largely come down to doing operations on polynomials'
---


# Polynomials in zkSNARKs
---
description: >-
  Core concept: zkSNARKs make polynomials, commit to them and then query them to
  make proofs
