# 1. Argument of Knowledge

In exploring new areas, the first task is usually figuring out what the definitions are. This is especially true in mathematics. And this is partly why a field like zero-knowledge proofs can seem so confusing and overwhelming. Settling on definitions takes time and effort, but in a space where new discoveries are a relatively common occurrence, most experts are focused on what is next instead of trying to explain what has already happened, especially in common language.&#x20;

In the following sections, we will outline a few simple ideas so that we can build upon them to arrive at a far more complex and more powerful tool: zero-knowledge proofs.
