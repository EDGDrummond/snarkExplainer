# Recap

<mark style="color:purple;">**zkSNARKs**</mark> are a type of <mark style="color:purple;">**verifiable computation**</mark> where a <mark style="color:purple;">**verifier**</mark> can check if a computation was done correctly. A <mark style="color:purple;">**proof system**</mark> is a specific method for a <mark style="color:purple;">**prover**</mark> to create a <mark style="color:purple;">**ZK proof**</mark> showing a <mark style="color:purple;">**circuit**</mark> was filled in correctly with a valid <mark style="color:purple;">**witness**</mark>. <mark style="color:purple;">**ZK circuits**</mark> are created via <mark style="color:purple;">**arithmetization**</mark> while computer circuits are created using <mark style="color:purple;">**Boolean algebra**</mark>. Both types of circuits are useful and both are consistent mathematical systems built on founding <mark style="color:purple;">**axioms**</mark> and derived <mark style="color:purple;">**theorems**</mark>**.**

## Terms

<mark style="color:purple;">**Axiom**</mark>: Founding assumptions

<mark style="color:purple;">**Theorem**</mark>: Truths derived from axioms and definitions&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Proof system**</mark>: Mathematically consistent systems for creating valid claims or arguments of knowledge

<mark style="color:purple;">**zkSNARK**</mark>: System that allows us to make justifications (in the form of ZK proofs) about the truthfulness of a computation, selectively revealing wire values&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**ZK proof**</mark> A piece of data that claims a circuit has been filled out correctly&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Verifiable computation**</mark>: A system that allows claims to be made about some computation having been done correctly

<mark style="color:purple;">**Verifier**</mark>: Decides whether a proof is satisfactory enough to justify its claims.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Prover**</mark>: Generator of a proof

<mark style="color:purple;">**Boolean algebra**</mark>**:** System of mathematics used to create computers circuits; the values are TRUE or FALSE; the operators are AND, OR, NOT

<mark style="color:purple;">**Arithmetization**</mark>: System of mathematics used to create ZK circuits; the values are numbers in a predetermined set (finite field); the operators are addition and multiplication

<mark style="color:purple;">**Circuit**</mark>: A set of constraints (some of the wire values are decided, and some are variable), usually representing some interesting computation

<mark style="color:purple;">**Witness**</mark>: The list of specific values variables in a circuit take
