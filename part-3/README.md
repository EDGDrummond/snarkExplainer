# Part 3. Proof systems in the wild

Now that you have an idea about all the most basic building blocks used to create a SNARK, letâ€™s explore some popular proof systems. A proof system is how a proof becomes real. Each system uses different methods for creating circuits and comes with different advantages and trade-offs. As an analogy, if a proof is a car, then the proof system is the design of the car factory.
