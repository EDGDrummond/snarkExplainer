# ü™Ñ SNARK Fundamentals: A Complete Beginner's Introduction

**Motivation**

Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs were first discovered and written about in the 1980s. [‚ÄúThe Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The\_Knowledge\_Complexity\_Of\_Interactive\_Proof\_Systems.pdf)‚Äù presented a theory of knowledge in which what was true was not simply what was witnessed or observed. Instead, zero-knowledge proofs say a thing is true only if you can create a mathematical proof that it is true.  A thing was true if it could be computed in an objectively verifiable way.&#x20;

This new system came with interesting properties. The first is that a proof reveals only one valid statement. No other information is revealed. With this zero-knowledge property, money, voting, identity, and many other multi-party systems could be designed in a way where privacy is preserved.&#x20;

Cryptographic protocols made navigating and spending money in open digital spaces like the internet possible because we trust cryptography to do things like validate our identities, verify the places we visit online, and allow only us to access our bank accounts. But the internet has changed drastically since the early era, and many have now come to realize that the data we create doesn‚Äôt belong to us and we are tracked and surveilled to no end. With an upgrade in cryptography in the form of zero-knowledge technology and the motivation to build things differently, we can create protocols, platforms, and applications with privacy as the default.

The other property of ZK proofs is efficiency. Notably a type of ZK proof called [zkSNARKs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-94UhJLeck) had to be succinct: a small amount of data that is fast to verify. It must take less time to verify a SNARK proof than to recompute the statements the SNARK is proving are valid. This scaling property could help make other technologies, especially decentralized ones like Ethereum, faster and more efficient without any sacrifice in validity.&#x20;

Zero-knowledge proofs say a thing is true only if you can create a mathematical proof that it is true. And the proof is only true if it satisfies the verifier. And the verifier is only satisfied if the witness is correct. And the witness is only correct if‚Ä¶ And so on. And so on, deep into the depths of mathematical theory.&#x20;

When you realize that math used in cryptography can be thought of in relatively simple terms: as materials, building blocks, and tools. And some materials are chosen because they are very hard while others are chosen because they can be easily constrained, shaped, and manipulated like plastic. And some of these tools provide randomness. And some blocks fit together, while others don‚Äôt. Then it all becomes relatively simple to think about and we can see complex technologies like ZK proofs as less mysterious and perhaps even as something we can help shape in our own way.

In this mini course we have one core aim, to provide enough understanding to be able to meaningfully engage in high level conversation about this technology. We are doing that by demystifying some of the core mathematical components as well as discussing general properties.
