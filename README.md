# ðŸª„ SNARK Fundamentals: A Complete Beginner's Introduction

Is this course for me? \
\
This is a really important question to ask yourself before any commitment, regardless of its size. If you intend to do or learn anything related to this technology **and are not sure where to start,** then then this course will be helpful to you.&#x20;

Regardless of background, most people with some dedication, should be able to follow all the concepts presented here. In this adventure we will look at the defining characteristics of zkSNARK technology, a peak at some of the mathematics underlying it, and then a brief overview of some of the systems out there.

***

[Part 1 (What are SNARKs?)](part-1/) of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_no mathematical background ===> high-level understanding of SNARKs_
{% endhint %}

By the end of Part 1 you should have some intuition for what is and isn't possible with SNARK technology.

[Part 2 (Math to get to PLONK)](part-2/) of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_high-level understanding of SNARKs ===> functional understanding of SNARKs_
{% endhint %}

Part 2 will delve into the mathematics and applied aspects of SNARKs. After Part 2, you should be able to understand how and why SNARKs are able to verify computations.

[Part 3 (Proof systems in the wild) ](part-3/)of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_functional understanding of SNARKs ===> ability to meaningfully engage with SNARKS_
{% endhint %}

By the end of Part 3, you should have enough understanding about this technology to engage in high level, meaningful conversations about it. And hopefully know enough to start building.

Zero-knowledge proofs say a thing is true only if you can create a mathematical proof that it is true. And the proof is only true if it satisfies the verifier. And the verifier is only satisfied if the witness is correct. And the witness is only correct ifâ€¦ And so on. And so on, deep into the depths of mathematical theory.&#x20;

When you realize that math used in cryptography can be thought of in relatively simple terms: as materials, building blocks, and tools. And some materials are chosen because they are very hard while others are chosen because they can be easily constrained, shaped, and manipulated like plastic. And some of these tools provide randomness. And some blocks fit together, while others donâ€™t. Then it all becomes relatively simple to think about and we can see complex technologies like ZK proofs as less mysterious and perhaps even as something we can help shape in our own way.

In this mini course we have one core aim, to provide enough understanding to be able to meaningfully engage in high level conversation about this technology. We are doing that by demystifying some of the core mathematical components as well as discussing general properties.
