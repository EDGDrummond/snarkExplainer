# ðŸª„ SNARK Fundamentals: A Complete Beginner's Introduction

Is this course for me? \
\
This is a really important question to ask yourself before any commitment, regardless of its size. If you intend to do or learn anything related to this technology **and are not sure where to start,** then then this course will be helpful to you. Most people, regardless of background, should be able to follow all the concepts presented here.&#x20;

In this adventure we will look at the defining characteristics of zkSNARK technology, a peak at some of the mathematics underlying it, and then a brief overview of some of the systems out there.

***

[Part 1 (What are SNARKs?)](part-1/) of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_no mathematical background ===> high-level understanding of SNARKs_
{% endhint %}

By the end of Part 1 you should have some intuition for what is and isn't possible with SNARK technology.

[Part 2 (Math to get to PLONK)](part-2/) of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_high-level understanding of SNARKs ===> functional understanding of SNARKs_
{% endhint %}

Part 2 will delve into the mathematics and applied aspects of SNARKs. After Part 2, you should be able to understand how and why SNARKs are able to verify computations.

[Part 3 (Proof systems in the wild) ](part-3/)of this course take you from:

{% hint style="success" %}
_functional understanding of SNARKs ===> ability to meaningfully engage with SNARKS_
{% endhint %}

By the end of Part 3, you should have enough understanding about this technology to engage in high level, meaningful conversations about it. And hopefully know enough to start building.
