# ðŸª„ SNARK Fundamentals

Welcome to the SNARK Fundamentals course. This course starts from scratch, meaning that no technical or mathematical background is required - everything should be understandable with a bit of effort on the part of the reader. Part 1 (sections 1-3) of this course take you from

```
no mathematical background ===> a functional understanding of SNARKs
```

What do we mean by a functional understanding? We want you to understand this technology in the same way that most people understand computers, the internet or WiFi; they don't know how it works, but they know what it does and they know how to use it. By the end of section 3 you should have some intuition for what is and isn't possible with SNARK technology, and be able to engage in high level, meaningful conversations about it.

To highlight, because it is so important, the target audience for sections 1-3 of the course is:

```
Anybody looking to gain a high-level understanding of SNARK technology
```

This means that anybody can do these parts. Moreover, we will not be delving into much mathematical detail to ensure anybody can do these parts from start to end. SNARK tools are mathematical ideas turned into reality with code, but you do not need to dig into the details in order to gain a functional understanding.&#x20;

Sections 4 & 5 will delve into the mathematics and applied aspects of SNARKs, and part 6 will give a high level overview of the space.
